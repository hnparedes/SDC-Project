# Secure Data Container (zip-archive based) and a Viewer
Project was made for CEN 4033: Secure Software Engineering.

The project will contain two pieces of software: One to generate a Secure Data Container as an encrypted archive in a password-protected zip file, and a Viewer to view and decrypt the SDC. The project will contain user access control to limit what files certain privlege levels can access.

(README.md will be updated with further project progress)
